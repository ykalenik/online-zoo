# Online-zoo :panda_face:
This is a training project to create a website containing several pages to demonstrate my front-end skills.

This project was an assignment from the course "JS/FE Course EN 2022Q3" offered by [RS School](https://rs.school/).

## About this project
Online-zoo is a platform that contains information about animals from various zoos with webcams.

It is assumed that a user can open the page with zoo resources, observe one of the animals, or make a donation that will be used to purchase food.
